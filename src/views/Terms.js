      <h4>Posted March 23/22</h4>

      <p className='my-8 block'>Monastery Gyatso NFT is a collection of digital caps based on our physical cap, The Gyatso. It runs as a non-fungible token on the ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN. Monasterynft.com is the only webpage to mint this NFT. Later on, it will be available on secondary markets like OpenSea. Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Ethereum wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Additionally, it is essential to mention that it is impossible to undo, reverse or restore any transactions as the Monastery Gyatso NFT smart contract runs on the Ethereum network. </p>

      <p className='my-8 block'>A. The buyer, in this case, you, owns the NFT. Each Monastery Gyatso is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Monastery Gyatso NFT, which means you own the art completely.

For clarification purposes, nothing in this Section will restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Monastery Gyatso NFTs generally, ensuring that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Monastery Gyatso NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Monastery Gyatso NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third-party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of Monastery Gyatso NFT generally, ensuring that the third-party website or application cryptographically verifies each Monastery Gyatso NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Monastery Gyatso NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Monastery Gyatso NFT leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.
